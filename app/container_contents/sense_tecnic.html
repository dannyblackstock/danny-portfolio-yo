Role
Redesign icons and interface elements for a mobile web application.

Year
2013

Project Type
Mobile device interface design and development

Tools
Illustrator, Photoshop, Kurugo, CSS

I volunteered to create the graphics for a mobile application being developed by Sense Tecnic, a small Vancouver software company.

For this project, I redesigned the graphics for a concept mobile application for the city of Richmond, BC. This included creating improved icons, as well as interface elements like menus and buttons, based on icons that had previously been used, while also keeping it consistent with the existing Richmond brand and website design.

In addition, I made sure that the graphics I created looked good on high resolution displays like those found on the new iPhone and Android devices. I then implemented them into the web application, which is built on the Kurugo mobile framework.

The demo application can be viewed here.
