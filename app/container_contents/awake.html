    My three teammates and I created this short film, entitled “Awake,” as a final project for a film course at Simon Fraser University. The most interesting (and longest) process of this project was creating a story we would be able to turn into a short film. We aimed to use minimal dialogue and few characters to keep production simple enough to fit our time constraints, but also to have an intriguing storyline with subtle details and a strong ending to engage the audience.

    Writing, Storyboarding, and Shooting
  </p>
  <p class="body-content">
    I helped write the story, and I also created the storyboards, where I planned each shot to help tell the story and convey emotion. I did this through describing the framing, angles, and camera movements that I thought would emphasize the feeling of a scene or progress the story. I referred to these storyboards throughout the shooting, and also tried to use lighting to enhance the feelings we were trying to convey. I was responsible for a majority of the cinematography and direction on set.

    Editing
  </p>

  <p class="body-content">
    I was also the main editor on the film. I used Premiere Pro for a majority of the editing, then used After Effects for final colour grading. I changed the pacing of cuts within different scenes affect the feel of certain scenes. For example, I used quick transitions during the intense final scene, to keep the viewers on edge and create a feeling of uneasiness.
