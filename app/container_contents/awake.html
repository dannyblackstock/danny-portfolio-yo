    My three teammates and I created this short film, entitled “Awake,” as a final project assignment for a film course at Simon Fraser University. The longest, and most interesting process of this project was creating a story we wanted to turn into a short film. We aimed to use minimal dialogue and not many characters to keep production simple, but also to have an intriguing storyline with subtle details and a twist ending to engage the audience.

    I helped write the story, and I also created the storyboards, where I planned each shot to help tell the story and convey emotion. I did this through describing the framing, angles, and camera movements that I thought would emphasize the feeling of a scene or progress the story. I referred to these storyboards throughout the shooting, and also tried to use lighting to enhance the feelings we were trying to convey. I was responsible for a majority of the cinematography and direction on set.

    I was also the main editor of the film. I used Premiere Pro for a majority of the editing, then used After Effects for final colour grading. I changed the pacing of cuts within different scenes to add to the feeling of certain scenes. For example, I used quick transitions during the intense final scene, to keep the viewer on edge and give a feeling of uneasiness.

    As of May 2014, “Awake” has received over 350,000 views on Youtube.
