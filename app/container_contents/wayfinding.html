        This project was developed as a final project assignment for an Information Design course.
    </p>
    <p>
        My team of three, including me, developed a prototype app for Blue Mountain Park in Coquitlam, to allow users to find
        information about and be guided around the various locations of the park.
    </p>
    <p>
        We studied the how people used the space and facilities there, and how they navigated the park. I worked with
        my team to create user personas in Illustrator that assisted us with designing for our intended audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        I designed the overall interface for the app, and around half of the icons for the locations. The interface was designed through
        sketching and user testing, and then the icons and interface were both finished in Illustrator. I then brought the Illustrator
        drawings into Flash, and created an interactive demo application.

    The user can create a "day plan", which allows them add locations that they would like to visit,
    and the app will give them information about the location, and route them to the locations in one
    continuous path. We also gave users the ability to save their car location when they enter the park.
    If they open the app within a certain distance of a parking lot, and they haven't already saved the
    car location, they can choose to do so, and then later can find a route through the park back to their car.
