    Hi, I’m Danny Blackstock. I am a multidisciplinary designer and a senior student pursuing a B.Sc. at the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/siat.html">School of Interactive Arts and Technology</a>. I enjoy learning how and why people’s everyday experiences can be affected by design. I have a strong interest and skills in user interface design, web development, and videography. I also like epic hiking adventures, playing drums, cars, skiing, tennis, and rock music (<a href="http://www.last.fm/user/mooglybear">check out my Last.fm profile</a>).
