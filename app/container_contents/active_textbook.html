  <p class="body-content">
    <a href="http://www.activetextbook.com/">Active Textbook</a> is a Ruby on Rails e-reading web application developed by <a href="http://www.evidentpoint.com">Evident Point</a>, a software company based in Richmond, British Columbia. I worked on the project as the sole in-house User Interface Designer / Developer, where I was tasked with redesigning many key features of the reader and user dashboard, as well as designing the interfaces for new features.

  <p class="paragraph-heading">
    Hotspot Creation
  </p>

  <p class="body-content">
    One of the first tasks I was assigned involved redesigning a feature that allows users to add media or other interactive elements – called “hotspots” – on to a page. Since the target audience for this feature was educators who may not have technical backgrounds, I tried to create a workflow that would be straightforward and easy to use.
  </p>
  <p class="body-content">
    After the user selects where they would like to add the media to their e-book, I divided the following process into two steps, in order to guide the user and make the differences between media types more clear. For the first step, I designed large, clickable icons for each type of hotspot. The second step allows the user to input a title and content of the hotspot.

  <p class="paragraph-heading">
    Media Library
  </p>

  <p class="body-content">
    While redesigning the hotspot creation process, I also designed the interface for a file storage system, called the “media library.” This feature allows the user to upload and reuse files when creating image, audio, video, or attachment hotspots. I created a modular solution that works well in different sizes and on different devices, and allows users to filter, preview, delete, and select media items in all of these contexts.

  </div>

  <p class="body-content">
    In the user’s dashboard, a side panel appears that can be used to view detailed information about each media item, as well as see where each item is used in a user's Active Textbooks.

  </div>

  <p class="paragraph-heading">
    Settings Modal
  </p>

  <p class="body-content">
    Another feature I designed for the Active Textbook reader was the settings modal window, which allows users to view and modify information about their book and media library. I decided to use a side tab bar to split up the information, in order to be more digestible by the users, and so that more tabs can be added in the future if necessary. I also wanted the tabs to be large enough to be easily clickable on touch devices.

  <p class="paragraph-heading">
    Custom Client Designs
  </p>

  <p class="body-content">
    I also worked with a variety of different clients who licensed custom versions of Active Textbook. For <a href="http://www.yourlibrary.ca/">Richmond Public Library</a>, I designed and implemented a <a href="http://create.yourlibrary.ca">custom skin for their user dashboard</a> using their branding and style. I also implemented a custom Active Textbook skin for <a href="https://www.rmbookshelf.com/">RM Books</a>, using their own designs.

    Native Tablet and Desktop Apps
  </p>

  <p class="body-content">
    I designed interfaces for native iOS, Android, and Windows applications for Active Textbook as well. I generated all the image assets for the applications, and also wrote HTML and CSS used for the Windows application from scratch, which was then implemented into the native Windows application by another developer.

    Active Textbook Online Store

  <p class="body-content">
    Near the end of my time at Evident Point, I was tasked with designing the user interface for an Active Textbook online store, where users could buy or rent books. I implemented my designs using HTML and SASS into a Ruby on Rails application.
