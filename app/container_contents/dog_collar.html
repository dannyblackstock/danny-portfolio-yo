  <p class="body-content">
    This project was completed for an Interaction Design Methods course at Simon Fraser University. The main focus of this project was to learn and apply user experience research methods.
  </p>

  <p class="body-content">
    My three teammates and I chose to analyze the interactions within a local Vancouver dog hiking and walking group, and design a technology solution to improve an aspect of the group. As a result, we created prototypes for an interactive dog collar and wristband that informs users about their dog’s health and activities, in order to improve the dog-owner relationship.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph-heading">Personas</p>
  <p class="body-content">
    After we found a social group to work with, we started by attending a few of their meet ups, in order to get to know them, observe, and ask questions. Once we had collected sufficient data, my team and I created personas to help us think about the goals, desires, characteristics of the dog walking group members, and to guide us throughout the design process.

  <p class="paragraph-heading">Cultural Probes</p>
  <p class="body-content">
    Next, we created a cultural probe, in the form of fun and engaging activities for four of our users to complete. These helped our team improve to our relationship with the group members, and also gather ethnographic data, so we could narrow our design focus.
  </p>

  <p class="body-content">
    The wooden box we gave to them included a custom dog journal that I designed, a custom disposable camera with a checklist of things to photograph, and various dog treats and accessories. The response we received from our participants was amazing – one participant even typed out her answers and glued them into her journal. After analyzing the results, we decided to focus on finding ways to enhance the dog-owner relationship, since we found that it was extremely significant and intimate for our participant group members.

  <p class="paragraph-heading">Storyboards and Journey Frameworks</p>
  <p class="body-content">
      After we had decided to focus on enhancing the dog-owner relationship, I came up with the idea of creating a dog collar that lights up to show the owner how far away their dog is when walking in the dark, which was a common activity for members of the dog walking group. My team and I also considered making a training device that rewards dogs if they do something good, and discourages them from bad behaviour.
  </p>

  <p class="body-content">
      We developed these ideas further, by coming up with a dog collar and wristband combination that lets the user know information about their dog via sensors, visual and sensory feedback, and a device that dispenses treats but can also shoot water at the dog as punishment. We then created journey frameworks as a team (inspired by <a href="http://www.ideo.com/images/uploads/news/pdfs/metropolis_1.pdf" title="Metropolis IDEO Framework">IDEO's</a>), and I drew storyboards to look at specific contexts in which the dog owners might use these product ideas.

  <p class="paragraph-heading">Participatory Workshop</p>
  <p class="body-content">
      With these concepts in mind, my team and I designed and held a participatory design workshop with three participants from the dog walking group. The aim was to get input how users would design their own products, and to get feedback on the ideas and storyboards we came up with. I facilitated the activities, which included brainstorming with provided words, images, and emotion stickers, creating their own wristband that shows information about their dog, and creating their own dog training device.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p class="body-content">
      After holding the workshop, we learned that the health of their dog was very important to owners, as injured or sick dogs can result in very expensive vet bills. They also wanted to have a way of knowing how their dog is doing remotely. We decided to develop the dog collar and wristband concept further as a result of these findings.

  <p class="paragraph-heading">Final Prototypes and Video</p>
  <p class="body-content">
    Our final wristband and dog collar low-fidelity prototypes enhances the dog-owner relationship by providing users with the dog’s current health conditions, alerts for vital states, reminders, and activity tracking through visual, vibration, and heat feedback. I edited and helped shoot the video, and helped create the final physical prototypes.

  <p class="body-content">
      We chose a wristband instead of a phone or smart watch app, not only because owners won’t need to pull out their phones to check on their dog, but also because we take advantage of the wristband hardware and form. We use the heat feedback to send the owner a heat pulse when their dog has a fever or is over-exerting itself, for example. The vibration can be used for alerts, or to alert the dog when the owner is about to arrive home, creating a sense of anticipation for the dog.
