<p>This video showcases my cinematography, editing, lighting, and colour grading work from the last few years. I did this project because I thought it would be fun to create a "demo reel" of some of my best shots.</p>

<p>I created the video using footage from my own personal projects as well as volunteering, and editing them to music using Premiere Pro. The colouring and intro title was done in After Effects.</p>
